# Fake-news

This project uses a neural network that identifies the critical features of text material (i.e., the distribution of words in the text) to distinguish fake news from real news. I will pre-process the text data I have (e.g., clean from stopwords, remove punctuation) and implement a feedforward neural network that will maximize the accuracy of predictions through penalizing the binary cross-entropy score explained further in the paper. I will present a working code and visualizations of the result and include a brief description of the used methods. 

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv).
